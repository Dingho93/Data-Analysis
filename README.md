# Data-Analysis Projects and Assignments done during my IBM certification and Bootcamp

Projects completed using Google Colab worksheets of Python-programming, Excel, where I had the opportunity to deep learning for Computer-vision, Data-mining, Data-analysis are included.

1.Python programming exercises:

The worksheets contains questions and program solutions related to various python concepts.

2.Data analysis:

Analysis and visualization of diffrent real world dataset of different domains and extract target information from the bulk data for processing or visualisation.
Folder contains the colab notebooks that were prepared during the Bootcamp and IBM data analysis course.

3.Data mining:

Contains domonstration of different data mining and data cleaning techniques used on real world datasets like basketball rewards,diabetic,covid etc.

4.Deep-learning with computer-vision:

Deep learning techniques used for image classification and prediction.
Implementation of gradient descent algorithm for 2 variables, which takes function,initial weights as input and outputs the correct updated weights.
Demonstration of different types of images and properties.
